Please add your logo image file here to display on all pages.

Steps (Windows):
1. Copy the file from your Downloads folder:
   copy "C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\PIC_AAGAM.JPG.png" "C:\Users\DELL\.aws\store\frontend\images\aagam.png"

2. After copying, reload the site in the browser to see the logo appear in headers.

If you want a different filename, update the <img src> in the header elements (e.g., /images/your-file.png).
